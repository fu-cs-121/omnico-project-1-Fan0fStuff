## Introduction

Euphoria is a social platform responsible for providing unique and emotionally stimulating content to its users. This analysis is aimed to decipher the amount of time users engage with one of our products as well as how happy it makes them feel. 

## Methodology

When performing this task, it was important to know our averages. When typing in our code, it was important to have values for each specific variable as well as the total number of variables that existed in a group (duration, happiness). Dividing the total of values by the number of sessions gives us the average. In finding the highest of each variable, I found it important to make sure that the value was higher than the rest. I then wanted to report my findings. As algorithm was already defined, I was able to use 'data' to introduce the number from each type of variable. For every type of variable, I was able to get back the desired number.
