# Omnico Project 1 Evaluation for William Nix

### Code Functionality and Implementation

- Your **main.py** file correctly reads the CSV data, converts the necessary fields to integers, and updates the statistics in the dictionary.
- You calculate the averages for happiness and session duration per algorithm and then correctly determine the algorithm with the highest average happiness and longest average session duration.
- Your use of f-strings to print out the formatted report meets the requirements—even though you aren’t enforcing a fixed decimal format, the functionality is sound.
- Overall, your code is well organized and follows most of the project instructions.

### Report Presentation and Consistency

- Your **report.md** is well-structured; you include an Introduction, Methodology, Results, Observations & Insights, and Conclusions & Recommendations as required.
- You clearly list the average happiness ratings, total session counts, and average session durations for each algorithm.
- **Note:** There is an inconsistency in the reported numbers. In your Results section you list:

  - **Average Session Duration per Algorithm:**
    - JoyStream: 4 minutes
    - SerenityFlow: 3 minutes
    - DeepPulse: 3 minutes
  - Yet under “Highest and Lowest Performers” you report the Longest Average Session Duration as 45.

  This suggests that you may have inadvertently mixed up the total session count (45 for DeepPulse) with the average duration. Make sure that the metric for “Longest Average Session Duration” uses the computed average values (as in your code) rather than another number.

  **For example, if DeepPulse’s computed average session duration is 3 minutes, then the longest average session duration should reflect that value.**  
  You might update that part of your report to match the averages shown above or recalculate if the CSV data produced different values.

### General Feedback

- Your implementation of the CSV parsing, statistics calculation, and final report printing follows the project requirements nicely.
- Moving forward, double-check that all numbers reported in your final documentation are consistent with the outputs generated by your program.
- Great job on making your code work correctly and on seeking help (shout-out to Dani!) when you needed it.

Overall, your project demonstrates a strong understanding of the required concepts. Just review the numerical consistency in your report to ensure that every metric is reported accurately.
